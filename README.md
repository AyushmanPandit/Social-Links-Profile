## My process

-   First, I reviewed the given designs to me and planned accordingly what elements should I create and what classes should I assign to them
-   Then, I wrote the html for the website with the planned classes
-   Next, I referred to the style guide and checked for the fonts used, the colors that were employed and then added those to the style sheet.
-   After that, I styled all the elements section-wise one by one until I was satisfied with the section before moving on to the next one.
-   FInally, I reviewed my website, compared it with the designs given and made minute changes for it look as close to the original as possible.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

While I didn't learn anything new while building this project, I revised the concepts that I already know and gained more confidence in designing the website, thus, polishing my skills even further. This project also helped me further strengthen my knowledge of flexbox.

### Continued development

For a short while, I will be continuing with practicing HTML and CSS, before moving on to more complex projects. Once I'm completely comfortable with HTML and CSS and their concepts like Flex, Grid etc., I will learn JS and tackle challenged involving JS.
